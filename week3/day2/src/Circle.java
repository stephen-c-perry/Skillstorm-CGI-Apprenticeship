     * or some other property of one of the circles and then print them out again.
     * (Note, the other circles' values should not have changed).
     * 
     * Requirements:
     * 
     * Contains useful methods calculating a circle's diameter, circumference, and
     * area.
     * Be able to create a Circle object by either providing a radius, or, if none
     * is provided, creates a circle with some default radius instead.
     * Have the ability to create multiple Circle objects and have their data be
     * independent of one another.
     * Fully encapsulate the class
     * Bonus Challenge:
     * 
     * Create a method that compares one Circle object with another and determine
     * whether they're equal or not.
     * Push your code to GitHub and provide a link instead of uploading your .java
     * file.
