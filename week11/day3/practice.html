            <p>Our new Soft Slide Formula (SSF) will be formulated in multiple hardnesses, is faster rolling, and will outlast anything currently on the market by many times. Super fast, incredibly durable, and they slide. SSF is a new paradigm, opening up even more of our concrete and asphalt cityscapes, roads, and hills to skating.

                Snakes are the softest of the SSF / Soft Slide Formula family. Built for high speed control and extra roll on any terrain. Rail corners, slash driveways, cruise them and drift them. Snakes will roll farther with every push, slide easier, hook up more smoothly, and last longer.</p>
