    Instructions
    In your group, write a program for calculating a students grade based on the grade breakdown:

    Assignments: 25%
    Quizzes: 25%
    Projects: 50%
    
    Output the result, for example:

    Enter in your overall assignment grade as a number between 0-100: 90 
    Enter in your overall quiz grade as a number between 0-100: 80
    Enter in your overall project grade as a number between 0-100: 70

    Your overall grade is: 80% */
